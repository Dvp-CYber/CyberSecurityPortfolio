# Cybersecurity Hands-On Labs

This repository contains my practical cybersecurity projects and exercises completed on **TryHackMe**. It demonstrates hands-on experience across multiple domains, including offensive security, defensive security, Linux fundamentals, Python scripting, network services, and Nmap scanning.  

The repo highlights skills such as:  
- Ethical hacking and penetration testing  
- Incident response and SOC workflows  
- Malware analysis and threat intelligence  
- Linux command-line proficiency  
- Python scripting and automation  

Each folder or file in this repository corresponds to a specific lab, with notes, screenshots, and references to the corresponding TryHackMe room for verification.
